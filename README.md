# Adset - Advanced Sets

Advanced Sets are a data structure that extend the normal sets, with methods that return Sets of specified data 
types, such as Arrays, Numbers, Strings, and Objects

Adset is based on [Enmap](https://github.com/eslachance/enmap) in that it is a structure that extends a basic 
JavaScript Object, [Sets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set), 
and add advanced utility methods to retrieve data easier.
